## Welcome
The Home Automation System API is an open source API that allows you to interact with a Beoremote Halo from a control system.
Using a websocket to communicate with the Beoremote Halo, it is possible to create a configuration of buttons on the Beoremote Halo to work with your Home automation to control all your
Home Automation systems with an easily accessible and wellcrafted remote.
The API works with both the wall mounted and the table versions of the Beoremote Halo. 
<br />

You can find out more about Beoremote Halo on the Bang & Olufsen retail website [here](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/accessories/beoremote-halo):

## Connecting to Beoremote Halo
Connection to Beoremote Halo is done using a websocket and connecting to Halo on Port:8080. 
Once connection is established a configuration must be sent to the remote for it to configure the screens and buttons. 
The Beoremote Halo will answer back with acknowledgements if the configuration was successful or not.
